# Hardware GS backend from DQ8-Recompiled

The SDL3 GPU implementation of PS2Recomp's GS raster backend
(`GSRasterBackend`), taken from
[DQ8-Recompiled](https://github.com/Sinan-Karakaya/DQ8-Recompiled) by Sinan
Karakaya, GPL-3.0 (see `LICENSE`), at commit
`3e74da68d7633db9996457dca4a9388ece0847c0` (2026-10-11). DQ8-Recompiled
builds on the same PS2Recomp fork this project pins.

## Changes for Rogue Galaxy

Rogue Galaxy uploads mostly 4- and 8-bit textures every frame and resolves
render targets about ten times a frame, both far more than DQ8; these
changes speed those paths up without changing their results. The first
commit of this folder is upstream as is, so `git log -p` on it shows them.

- `gs/gs_vram`: `writeRunT8`, `writeRunT4` and `readRowT4`, built on the
  same `PixelStorageTraits` and layout tables as GSMem, so addresses match
  (the game's `RG_SELFTEST=gs` checks them against GSMem).
- `gs/gs_transfer.cpp`: host-to-local PSMT8 and PSMT4 transfers write runs
  instead of one dispatched `write()` per pixel.
- `sdlgpu_textures.cpp`: PSMT4 textures expand through the palette
  `buildPalette` already resolved; the general path re-read every texel's
  CLUT entry from local memory.
- `sdlgpu_targets`: resolves reuse one download transfer buffer and one
  downscale staging texture instead of creating and releasing them each
  time (they wait for their fence, so both are idle again by the next).
- `sdlgpu_backend.cpp`: the feedback snapshot's tail upload reuses one
  transfer buffer mapped with cycling; the FPS readout keeps the window's
  own title in front instead of "DQ8Recomp".

One change fixes a result rather than speed: in `sdlgpu_backend.cpp`, a
scissor ending past the buffer (0 to 512 with FBW 8, in Rogue Galaxy's
menus) no longer grows the colour and depth surfaces past FBW pages unless
the geometry reaches there (a clear never does), and a draw's host scissor
and written region are clipped to its surface. Grown surfaces took in the page after the
buffer; texture uploads to it then discarded the depth buffer mid-frame.
